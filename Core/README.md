### Details of Properties and Methods

#### Property: `transferManager`

- **Type**: `TransferManager`
- **Description**:
    - `transferManager` is a lazily initialized property that provides a manager to orchestrate all transfer operations. It
      uses `realmProvider` and `apiClientProvider` to configure and manage transfers efficiently.

- **Usage Example**:
  ```kotlin
  val core = SwissTransferInjection()
  val transferManager = core.transferManager
  // Use the transferManager to orchestrate transfers
  ```

#### Method: `loadDefaultAccount`

- **Signature**: `fun loadDefaultAccount()`
- **Description**:
    - `loadDefaultAccount` is a method that loads the default user account and initializes Realm transfers for the default user ID
      defined in the constants. This method is essential to ensure the application is correctly set up for the default user from
      the start.

- **Usage Example**:
  ```kotlin
  val core = SwissTransferInjection()
  core.loadDefaultAccount()
  // The default user account is now loaded and ready to use
  ```
